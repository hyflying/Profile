This is  Evan. My tech adventure began after earning dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Japanese at DLUT.  Yes, I can code and say "Hello, World!" in Japanese!

I joined Meituan as an iOS developer after finishing my undergraduate studies. During the 2022 Shanghai lockdown, our app, Meituan Grocery, became a lifeline for thousands trapped at home. This experience cemented my belief in the power of technology to change lives, one app at a time.  Eager to level up my tech skills and broaden my horizons, I bid farewell to Meituan and set sail for the US to pursue my graduate studies. 

I'm currently seeking summer 2024 internship opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me for any exciting opportunities. Let's improve the digital world a better place, one line of code at a time!
